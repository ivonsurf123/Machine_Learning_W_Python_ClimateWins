# ClimateWins Weather Prediction Project

## Overview
#### This project is part of a machine learning course focused on predicting weather variations using advanced algorithms. The aim is to help ClimateWins, an organization committed to forecasting and understanding climate change, achieve its goals. The project spans two achievements, each exploring different machine learning techniques applied to historical weather data to predict atmospheric conditions.

## Objectives
##### * Identify weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
##### * Determine if unusual weather patterns are increasing over time.
##### * Generate possibilities for future weather conditions.
##### * Identify the safest places for people to live in Europe.

## DATA Source and Biases
##### • The data set based on weather was collected from 18 different weather stations across Europe.
##### • The data set contain information that rang from the late 1800s to 2022.
##### • Features include average temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, with labels for "pleasant" and "unpleasant" days.
##### • Collection Bias: Data is collected only from European weather stations.
##### • Location Bias: Weather data may not generalize to regions outside of Europe.
##### • Temporal Bias: Older data may not accurately represent current weather patterns.
