# **ClimateWins Weather Prediction Project**

## **Overview**
This project is part of a machine learning course focused on predicting weather variations using advanced algorithms. The aim is to help ClimateWins, an organization committed to forecasting and understanding climate change, achieve its goals. The project spans two achievements, each exploring different machine learning techniques applied to historical weather data to predict atmospheric conditions.

## **Objectives**
 * Identify weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
 * Determine if unusual weather patterns are increasing over time.
 * Generate possibilities for future weather conditions.
 * Identify the safest places for people to live in Europe.

## **DATA Source and Biases**

For this project, the following datasets were used:

1. **Weather Conditions Dataset**  
   Downloaded from Kaggle, this dataset includes images of various weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy.  
   [Download the dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratik2901/multiclass-weather-dataset)

2. **European Historical Weather Data**  
   This dataset includes historical weather data from various European cities used for training and testing weather prediction models.

3. **Answers Dataset for Pleasant Weather Prediction**  
   Provided by Career Foundry, this dataset labels "pleasant" days as `1` and "unpleasant" days as `0`. It was used to evaluate different machine      learning models for predicting pleasant weather based on weather observations.  
   *(This dataset is proprietary and not publicly available for download.)*
   
4. The data set based on weather was collected from 18 different weather stations across Europe.

5. The data set contain information that rang from the late 1800s to 2022.

6. Features include average temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, with labels for "pleasant" and "unpleasant" days.

7. Collection Bias: Data is collected only from European weather stations.

8. Location Bias: Weather data may not generalize to regions outside of Europe.

9. Temporal Bias: Older data may not accurately represent current weather patterns.

# Achievements Summary
**Achievement 1:** Statistical and Machine Learning Models

**Data Analysis:** Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical weather data.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Used to classify weather conditions based on temperature and other features.

**Linear and Logistic Regression:** Developed regression models for temperature trends and to classify binary outcomes (e.g., rain/no rain).

**Random Forest:** Applied to enhance prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
